Multimodes2 update file.

v0.1.2
- save_freq_list parameter allows to save intermediate results files each sim_fit_n iterations
- Minor improvements in efficiency.

v0.1.1 # Added by Antonio García Hernández
- FEATURE: MultiModes2 can be imported from a jupyter notebook or run in the terminal. See README.md for instructions.
- defaults function sets default parameter values. 
- osratio and max_freq are not global anymore
- isfits, isascii, timecol, fluxcol an    d headerline are not global anymore
- min_snr, S_N, max_fap and all_faps are not global anymore
- function arguments() parse the optional arguments
- dash is not global anymore
- Now, we have to pass the values of min_snr, S_N, max_fap and all_faps to snr_or_fap()
- Special variable __name__ == "__main__":

v0.1
- new parameter save_data_res to save a file containing the residuals every xx iterations.
- new parameter max_iter
- new parameter header_lines to skip the header lines (previously it was set to 1).
- Several fixes, code clean and optimised.
- Previous used of numba was causing issues and now is removed for stability.

Changes here above start from version 0.1, previous versions are not supported.
